# Data-Modelling-of-Soccer
This project aims to simulate Soccer Premier League matches using R Programming. The existing Premier League data is modeled as a Poisson Regression Model. The Poisson Regression Model is a Probability Model which can be used to predict the results of future Premier Leagues using which randomness of Soccer League Tables can be analyzed.
